# ERC20 Token Contract


The code you provided is an implementation of an ERC20 token contract in Solidity. Here's a brief description of the contract and its functionalities:


## Contract Overview

1) The contract is named "Solidity by Example" and has the symbol "SOLBYEX".

2)The token has 18 decimal places.

3)The total supply of tokens is stored in the totalSupply variable.

4)The balanceOf mapping keeps track of the token balance for each address.

5)The allowance mapping keeps track of the approved amount of tokens that can be spent by another address.

6)The contract emits Transfer and Approval events for token transfers and approvals.
## Token Operations

1)transfer: Allows an address to send tokens to another address. The function updates the token balances accordingly.

2)approve: Approves another address to spend a specified amount of tokens on behalf of the sender.

3)transferFrom: Allows an address with sufficient allowance to transfer tokens on behalf of the token owner.

4)mint: Creates new tokens and adds them to the balance of the calling address.

5)burn: Destroys a specified amount of tokens from the balance of the calling address.
## Health System

1)The contract includes a health system represented by the total_health variable. It starts with a value of 100.

2)The attack function allows the contract owner to decrease the health by a specified amount. If the damage exceeds 100, it throws an error indicating that the person is dead.

3)The heal function increases the health by 50 and caps it at a maximum of 100.

4)The totalhealth function returns the current health value.
## Vault Contract

1)The Vault contract allows users to deposit and withdraw tokens.

2)The token variable stores the address of the ERC20 token contract.

3)The totalSupply variable tracks the total shares in the vault.

4)The balanceOf mapping keeps track of the share balance for each address.

5)The deposit function allows users to deposit tokens into the vault, minting shares based on the proportion of the deposited amount to the total token balance in the vault.

6)The withdraw function allows users to withdraw tokens from the vault, burning the corresponding shares and transferring the proportionate amount of tokens back to the user.
## Description

The ERC20 token contract is an implementation of the ERC20 standard, which defines a set of functions and events for creating and managing fungible tokens. It includes variables such as totalSupply, balanceOf, and allowance to keep track of the token supply, individual balances of addresses, and approved spending amounts, respectively. The contract also defines a set of functions including transfer, approve, and transferFrom to enable token transfers and approvals. Additionally, it includes functions like mint and burn to create and destroy tokens, and a health system represented by the total_health variable, which can be modified using the attack and heal functions. Finally, the contract emits events Transfer and Approval when token transfers and approvals occur.

The Vault contract serves as a secure storage mechanism for tokens. It interacts with the ERC20 token contract to allow users to deposit and withdraw tokens. The contract takes the address of an ERC20 token in its constructor and defines a token variable to store the token contract instance. It maintains a totalSupply variable and a balanceOf mapping to keep track of the shares held by addresses. The contract provides a deposit function that allows users to deposit tokens into the vault. The function calculates the proportionate number of shares based on the deposited amount and the current token balance in the vault, and mints these shares to the sender. The tokens are transferred from the sender's address to the vault using the transferFrom function of the token contract. Similarly, the contract includes a withdraw function to enable users to withdraw tokens from the vault. The function calculates the proportionate amount of tokens based on the shares being withdrawn and transfers these tokens back to the sender's address, while burning the corresponding shares from the sender's balance.

## Usage

Deploying the Contracts:

Deploy the ERC20 token contract by compiling and deploying the ERC20 contract. Set the desired parameters such as the name, symbol, and decimals of the token.
Deploy the Vault contract by compiling and deploying the Vault contract, passing the address of the deployed ERC20 token contract as a constructor argument.
Interacting with the ERC20 Token:

Mint Tokens: Call the mint function of the ERC20 token contract to create new tokens. Specify the desired amount of tokens to be minted.
Transfer Tokens: Use the transfer function to send tokens from one address to another. Specify the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to transfer.
Approve Token Spending: Approve another address to spend a certain amount of tokens on your behalf using the approve function. Provide the spender's address and the approved token amount.
Transfer Tokens on Behalf: If you have an approved allowance, the approved address can transfer tokens on your behalf using the transferFrom function. Specify the sender's address, the recipient's address, and the amount of tokens to be transferred.
Health System Interaction:

Attack: Call the attack function to decrease the health level of the person or entity represented by the contract. Specify the amount of damage inflicted.
Heal: Use the heal function to increase the health level by 50. The maximum health level is capped at 100.
Check Total Health: Retrieve the current health level by calling the totalhealth function.
Interacting with the Vault:

Deposit Tokens: Call the deposit function of the Vault contract to deposit tokens into the vault. Specify the amount of tokens to be deposited.
Withdraw Tokens: Use the withdraw function to withdraw tokens from the vault. Specify the number of shares to be burned and receive the corresponding amount of tokens.
